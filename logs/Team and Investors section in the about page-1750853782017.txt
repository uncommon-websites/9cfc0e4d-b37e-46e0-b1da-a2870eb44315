Teams passed files back and forth, feedback got lost in threads, and by the time engineering had what they needed, the design had already changed. It was slow, inefficient, and frustrating for everyone involved.\",\n38: \t\t\"So we built something different. A browser-based platform where anyone—designer, developer, product manager—could work in the same place, at the same time. No downloads, no silos, no chaos. Just real-time collaboration that feels like magic. You could design, prototype, share, present, even engineer handoff—all in one live file that never goes out of date.\",\n39: \t\t\"Today, product teams at some of the world's most innovative companies rely on Figma. Not just because it's powerful, but because it helps people work better together. It's clearer communication, faster execution, and fewer handoff headaches. We didn't just change how design happens—we closed the gap between idea and reality. And we're just getting started.\"\n40: \t]}\n41: />\n42: \n43: <!-- Our Culture Section -->\n44: <Culture {values} />\n45: \n46: <!-- StakeholderGrid Section -->\n47: <StakeholderGrid\n48: \tstakeholderType=\"team\"\n49: \ttitle=\"Our team.\"\n50: \tsubtitle=\"Your partners in innovation.\"\n51: \tstakeholders={[\n52: \t\t{\n53: \t\t\tname: \"Dylan Field\",\n54: \t\t\tposition: \"Co-Founder & CEO\",\n55: \t\t\tbio: \"Leading Figma's mission to make design collaborative and accessible to everyone in the product development process.\",\n56: \t\t\timage:\n57: \t\t\t\t\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1560250097-0b93528c311a?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=774&q=80\"\n58: \t\t},\n59: \t\t{\n60: \t\t\tname: \"Diana Mounter\",\n61: \t\t\tposition: \"Head of Design\",\n62: \t\t\tbio: \"Passionate about creating intuitive tools that empower designers and developers to work better together.\",\n63: \t\t\timage:\n64: \t\t\t\t\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1573496359142-b8d87734a5a2?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=776&q=80\"\n65: \t\t},\n66: \t\t{\n67: \t\t\tname: \"Levon Sharrow\",\n68: \t\t\tposition: \"Director of Experience Design\",\n69: \t\t\tbio: \"Focused on building seamless experiences that bridge the gap between design vision and technical implementation.\",\n70: \t\t\timage:\n71: \t\t\t\t\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1580489944761-15a19d654956?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=774&q=80\"\n72: \t\t}\n73: \t]}\n74: />\n75: \n76: <StakeholderGrid\n77: \tstakeholderType=\"investor\"\n78: \ttitle=\"Backed by the best.\"\n79: \tsubtitle=\"Point Nine, TSIC and others\"\n80: \tstakeholders={[\n81: \t\t{\n82: \t\t\tname: \"Point Nine Capital\",\n83: \t\t\timage: \"https://cdn.brandfetch.io/pointnine.com/w/400/h/400/logo?c=1id_elLz2Bd5Ej-dWo7\"\n84: \t\t},\n85: \t\t{\n86: \t\t\tname: \"TSIC Ventures\",\n87: \t\t\timage: \"https://cdn.brandfetch.io/tiny.vc/w/400/h/400/logo?c=1a2b3c4d5e\"\n88: \t\t},\n89: \t\t{\n90: \t\t\tname: \"Sequoia Capital\",\n91: \t\t\timage: \"https://cdn.brandfetch.io/sequoiacap.com/w/400/h/400/logo\"\n92: \t\t}\n93: \t]}\n94: />\n95: \n96: <!-- CTA Section -->\n97: <CallToAction\n98: \ttitle=\"Ready to design together?\"\n99: \tsubtitle=\"Start building your next great product\"\n100: \tdescription=\"Join millions of designers and developers who use Figma to collaborate, prototype, and ship products faster than ever before.\"\n101: />\n102: \n\n\n══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\nFILE: ./src/lib/components/layout/StakeholderGrid.svelte\n══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\n1: <script lang=\"ts\">\n2: \timport SectionHeader from \"$lib/components/layout/SectionHeader.svelte\";\n3: \timport Button from \"$lib/components/ui/Button.svelte\";\n4: \timport { animate, stagger } from \"motion\";\n5: \timport { onMount } from \"svelte\";\n6: \n7: \t// Types\n8: \ttype Stakeholder = {\n9: \t\tname: string;\n10: \t\tposition?: string;\n11: \t\tbio?: string;\n12: \t\timage: string;\n13: \t};\n14: \n15: \t// Props\n16: \tconst {\n17: \t\ttitle,\n18: \t\tstakeholderType = \"team\",\n19: \t\tsubtitle,\n20: \t\tstakeholders\n21: \t}: {\n22: \t\tstakeholders: Stakeholder[];\n23: \t\ttitle: string;\n24: \t\tsubtitle: string;\n25: \t\tstakeholderType?: \"team\" | \"investor\";\n26: \t} = $props();\n27: \n28: \tlet cards: HTMLElement[] = $state([]);\n29: \n30: \tonMount(() => {\n31: \t\tif (window.self !== window.top) return;\n32: \t\tanimate(\n33: \t\t\tcards,\n34: \t\t\t{\n35: \t\t\t\ty: [\"1.5rem\", 0],\n36: \t\t\t\tfilter: [\"blur(2px)\", \"blur(0px)\"],\n37: \t\t\t\topacity: [0, 1]\n38: \t\t\t},\n39: \t\t\t{\n40: \t\t\t\tduration: 0.3,\n41: \t\t\t\tease: \"easeOut\",\n42: \t\t\t\tdelay: stagger(0.1, {\n43: \t\t\t\t\tease: \"easeInOut\"\n44: \t\t\t\t})\n45: \t\t\t}\n46: \t\t);\n47: \t});\n48: </script>\n49: \n50: <section class=\"\">\n51: \t<div class=\"section-py section-px container mx-auto grid [--gap:--spacing(4)]\">\n52: \t\t<SectionHeader {title} {subtitle} />\n53: \n54: \t\t<div\n55: \t\t\tclass=\"grid grid-cols-1 gap-(--gap) {stakeholders.length === 1\n56: \t\t\t\t?

Teams passed files back and forth, feedback got lost in threads, and by the time engineering had what they needed, the design had already changed. It was slow, inefficient, and frustrating for everyone involved.\",\n38: \t\t\"So we built something different. A browser-based platform where anyone—designer, developer, product manager—could work in the same place, at the same time. No downloads, no silos, no chaos. Just real-time collaboration that feels like magic. You could design, prototype, share, present, even engineer handoff—all in one live file that never goes out of date.\",\n39: \t\t\"Today, product teams at some of the world's most innovative companies rely on Figma. Not just because it's powerful, but because it helps people work better together. It's clearer communication, faster execution, and fewer handoff headaches. We didn't just change how design happens—we closed the gap between idea and reality. And we're just getting started.\"\n40: \t]}\n41: />\n42: \n43: <!-- Our Culture Section -->\n44: <Culture {values} />\n45: \n46: <!-- StakeholderGrid Section -->\n47: <StakeholderGrid\n48: \tstakeholderType=\"team\"\n49: \ttitle=\"Our team.\"\n50: \tsubtitle=\"Your partners in innovation.\"\n51: \tstakeholders={[\n52: \t\t{\n53: \t\t\tname: \"Dylan Field\",\n54: \t\t\tposition: \"Co-Founder & CEO\",\n55: \t\t\tbio: \"Leading Figma's mission to make design collaborative and accessible to everyone in the product development process.\",\n56: \t\t\timage:\n57: \t\t\t\t\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1560250097-0b93528c311a?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=774&q=80\"\n58: \t\t},\n59: \t\t{\n60: \t\t\tname: \"Diana Mounter\",\n61: \t\t\tposition: \"Head of Design\",\n62: \t\t\tbio: \"Passionate about creating intuitive tools that empower designers and developers to work better together.\",\n63: \t\t\timage:\n64: \t\t\t\t\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1573496359142-b8d87734a5a2?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=776&q=80\"\n65: \t\t},\n66: \t\t{\n67: \t\t\tname: \"Levon Sharrow\",\n68: \t\t\tposition: \"Director of Experience Design\",\n69: \t\t\tbio: \"Focused on building seamless experiences that bridge the gap between design vision and technical implementation.\",\n70: \t\t\timage:\n71: \t\t\t\t\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1580489944761-15a19d654956?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=774&q=80\"\n72: \t\t}\n73: \t]}\n74: />\n75: \n76: <StakeholderGrid\n77: \tstakeholderType=\"investor\"\n78: \ttitle=\"Backed by the best.\"\n79: \tsubtitle=\"Point Nine, TSIC and others\"\n80: \tstakeholders={[\n81: \t\t{\n82: \t\t\tname: \"Point Nine Capital\",\n83: \t\t\timage: \"https://cdn.brandfetch.io/pointnine.com/w/400/h/400/logo?c=1id_elLz2Bd5Ej-dWo7\"\n84: \t\t},\n85: \t\t{\n86: \t\t\tname: \"TSIC Ventures\",\n87: \t\t\timage: \"https://cdn.brandfetch.io/tiny.vc/w/400/h/400/logo?c=1a2b3c4d5e\"\n88: \t\t},\n89: \t\t{\n90: \t\t\tname: \"Sequoia Capital\",\n91: \t\t\timage: \"https://cdn.brandfetch.io/sequoiacap.com/w/400/h/400/logo\"\n92: \t\t}\n93: \t]}\n94: />\n95: \n96: <!-- CTA Section -->\n97: <CallToAction\n98: \ttitle=\"Ready to design together?\"\n99: \tsubtitle=\"Start building your next great product\"\n100: \tdescription=\"Join millions of designers and developers who use Figma to collaborate, prototype, and ship products faster than ever before.\"\n101: />\n102: \n\n\n══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\nFILE: ./src/lib/components/layout/StakeholderGrid.svelte\n══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\n1: <script lang=\"ts\">\n2: \timport SectionHeader from \"$lib/components/layout/SectionHeader.svelte\";\n3: \timport Button from \"$lib/components/ui/Button.svelte\";\n4: \timport { animate, stagger } from \"motion\";\n5: \timport { onMount } from \"svelte\";\n6: \n7: \t// Types\n8: \ttype Stakeholder = {\n9: \t\tname: string;\n10: \t\tposition?: string;\n11: \t\tbio?: string;\n12: \t\timage: string;\n13: \t};\n14: \n15: \t// Props\n16: \tconst {\n17: \t\ttitle,\n18: \t\tstakeholderType = \"team\",\n19: \t\tsubtitle,\n20: \t\tstakeholders\n21: \t}: {\n22: \t\tstakeholders: Stakeholder[];\n23: \t\ttitle: string;\n24: \t\tsubtitle: string;\n25: \t\tstakeholderType?: \"team\" | \"investor\";\n26: \t} = $props();\n27: \n28: \tlet cards: HTMLElement[] = $state([]);\n29: \n30: \tonMount(() => {\n31: \t\tif (window.self !== window.top) return;\n32: \t\tanimate(\n33: \t\t\tcards,\n34: \t\t\t{\n35: \t\t\t\ty: [\"1.5rem\", 0],\n36: \t\t\t\tfilter: [\"blur(2px)\", \"blur(0px)\"],\n37: \t\t\t\topacity: [0, 1]\n38: \t\t\t},\n39: \t\t\t{\n40: \t\t\t\tduration: 0.3,\n41: \t\t\t\tease: \"easeOut\",\n42: \t\t\t\tdelay: stagger(0.1, {\n43: \t\t\t\t\tease: \"easeInOut\"\n44: \t\t\t\t})\n45: \t\t\t}\n46: \t\t);\n47: \t});\n48: </script>\n49: \n50: <section class=\"\">\n51: \t<div class=\"section-py section-px container mx-auto grid [--gap:--spacing(4)]\">\n52: \t\t<SectionHeader {title} {subtitle} />\n53: \n54: \t\t<div\n55: \t\t\tclass=\"grid grid-cols-1 gap-(--gap) {stakeholders.length === 1\n56: \t\t\t\t?

Teams passed files back and forth, feedback got lost in threads, and by the time engineering had what they needed, the design had already changed. It was slow, inefficient, and frustrating for everyone involved.\",\n38: \t\t\"So we built something different. A browser-based platform where anyone—designer, developer, product manager—could work in the same place, at the same time. No downloads, no silos, no chaos. Just real-time collaboration that feels like magic. You could design, prototype, share, present, even engineer handoff—all in one live file that never goes out of date.\",\n39: \t\t\"Today, product teams at some of the world's most innovative companies rely on Figma. Not just because it's powerful, but because it helps people work better together. It's clearer communication, faster execution, and fewer handoff headaches. We didn't just change how design happens—we closed the gap between idea and reality. And we're just getting started.\"\n40: \t]}\n41: />\n42: \n43: <!-- Our Culture Section -->\n44: <Culture {values} />\n45: \n46: <!-- StakeholderGrid Section -->\n47: <StakeholderGrid\n48: \tstakeholderType=\"team\"\n49: \ttitle=\"Our team.\"\n50: \tsubtitle=\"Your partners in innovation.\"\n51: \tstakeholders={[\n52: \t\t{\n53: \t\t\tname: \"Dylan Field\",\n54: \t\t\tposition: \"Co-Founder & CEO\",\n55: \t\t\tbio: \"Leading Figma's mission to make design collaborative and accessible to everyone in the product development process.\",\n56: \t\t\timage:\n57: \t\t\t\t\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1560250097-0b93528c311a?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=774&q=80\"\n58: \t\t},\n59: \t\t{\n60: \t\t\tname: \"Diana Mounter\",\n61: \t\t\tposition: \"Head of Design\",\n62: \t\t\tbio: \"Passionate about creating intuitive tools that empower designers and developers to work better together.\",\n63: \t\t\timage:\n64: \t\t\t\t\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1573496359142-b8d87734a5a2?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=776&q=80\"\n65: \t\t},\n66: \t\t{\n67: \t\t\tname: \"Levon Sharrow\",\n68: \t\t\tposition: \"Director of Experience Design\",\n69: \t\t\tbio: \"Focused on building seamless experiences that bridge the gap between design vision and technical implementation.\",\n70: \t\t\timage:\n71: \t\t\t\t\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1580489944761-15a19d654956?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=774&q=80\"\n72: \t\t}\n73: \t]}\n74: />\n75: \n76: <StakeholderGrid\n77: \tstakeholderType=\"investor\"\n78: \ttitle=\"Backed by the best.\"\n79: \tsubtitle=\"Point Nine, TSIC and others\"\n80: \tstakeholders={[\n81: \t\t{\n82: \t\t\tname: \"Point Nine Capital\",\n83: \t\t\timage: \"https://cdn.brandfetch.io/pointnine.com/w/400/h/400/logo?c=1id_elLz2Bd5Ej-dWo7\"\n84: \t\t},\n85: \t\t{\n86: \t\t\tname: \"TSIC Ventures\",\n87: \t\t\timage: \"https://cdn.brandfetch.io/tiny.vc/w/400/h/400/logo?c=1a2b3c4d5e\"\n88: \t\t},\n89: \t\t{\n90: \t\t\tname: \"Sequoia Capital\",\n91: \t\t\timage: \"https://cdn.brandfetch.io/sequoiacap.com/w/400/h/400/logo\"\n92: \t\t}\n93: \t]}\n94: />\n95: \n96: <!-- CTA Section -->\n97: <CallToAction\n98: \ttitle=\"Ready to design together?\"\n99: \tsubtitle=\"Start building your next great product\"\n100: \tdescription=\"Join millions of designers and developers who use Figma to collaborate, prototype, and ship products faster than ever before.\"\n101: />\n102: \n\n\n══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\nFILE: ./src/lib/components/layout/StakeholderGrid.svelte\n══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\n1: <script lang=\"ts\">\n2: \timport SectionHeader from \"$lib/components/layout/SectionHeader.svelte\";\n3: \timport Button from \"$lib/components/ui/Button.svelte\";\n4: \timport { animate, stagger } from \"motion\";\n5: \timport { onMount } from \"svelte\";\n6: \n7: \t// Types\n8: \ttype Stakeholder = {\n9: \t\tname: string;\n10: \t\tposition?: string;\n11: \t\tbio?: string;\n12: \t\timage: string;\n13: \t};\n14: \n15: \t// Props\n16: \tconst {\n17: \t\ttitle,\n18: \t\tstakeholderType = \"team\",\n19: \t\tsubtitle,\n20: \t\tstakeholders\n21: \t}: {\n22: \t\tstakeholders: Stakeholder[];\n23: \t\ttitle: string;\n24: \t\tsubtitle: string;\n25: \t\tstakeholderType?: \"team\" | \"investor\";\n26: \t} = $props();\n27: \n28: \tlet cards: HTMLElement[] = $state([]);\n29: \n30: \tonMount(() => {\n31: \t\tif (window.self !== window.top) return;\n32: \t\tanimate(\n33: \t\t\tcards,\n34: \t\t\t{\n35: \t\t\t\ty: [\"1.5rem\", 0],\n36: \t\t\t\tfilter: [\"blur(2px)\", \"blur(0px)\"],\n37: \t\t\t\topacity: [0, 1]\n38: \t\t\t},\n39: \t\t\t{\n40: \t\t\t\tduration: 0.3,\n41: \t\t\t\tease: \"easeOut\",\n42: \t\t\t\tdelay: stagger(0.1, {\n43: \t\t\t\t\tease: \"easeInOut\"\n44: \t\t\t\t})\n45: \t\t\t}\n46: \t\t);\n47: \t});\n48: </script>\n49: \n50: <section class=\"\">\n51: \t<div class=\"section-py section-px container mx-auto grid [--gap:--spacing(4)]\">\n52: \t\t<SectionHeader {title} {subtitle} />\n53: \n54: \t\t<div\n55: \t\t\tclass=\"grid grid-cols-1 gap-(--gap) {stakeholders.length === 1\n56: \t\t\t\t?
