Teams passed files back and forth, feedback got lost in threads, and by the time engineering had what they needed, the design had already changed. It was slow, inefficient, and frustrating for everyone involved.\",\n38: \t\t\"So we built something different. A browser-based platform where anyone—designer, developer, product manager—could work in the same place, at the same time. No downloads, no silos, no chaos. Just real-time collaboration that feels like magic. You could design, prototype, share, present, even engineer handoff—all in one live file that never goes out of date.\",\n39: \t\t\"Today, product teams at some of the world's most innovative companies rely on Figma. Not just because it's powerful, but because it helps people work better together. It's clearer communication, faster execution, and fewer handoff headaches. We didn't just change how design happens—we closed the gap between idea and reality.

Teams passed files back and forth, feedback got lost in threads, and by the time engineering had what they needed, the design had already changed. It was slow, inefficient, and frustrating for everyone involved.\",\n38: \t\t\"So we built something different. A browser-based platform where anyone—designer, developer, product manager—could work in the same place, at the same time. No downloads, no silos, no chaos. Just real-time collaboration that feels like magic. You could design, prototype, share, present, even engineer handoff—all in one live file that never goes out of date.\",\n39: \t\t\"Today, product teams at some of the world's most innovative companies rely on Figma. Not just because it's powerful, but because it helps people work better together. It's clearer communication, faster execution, and fewer handoff headaches. We didn't just change how design happens—we closed the gap between idea and reality.

Teams passed files back and forth, feedback got lost in threads, and by the time engineering had what they needed, the design had already changed. It was slow, inefficient, and frustrating for everyone involved.\",\n38: \t\t\"So we built something different. A browser-based platform where anyone—designer, developer, product manager—could work in the same place, at the same time. No downloads, no silos, no chaos. Just real-time collaboration that feels like magic. You could design, prototype, share, present, even engineer handoff—all in one live file that never goes out of date.\",\n39: \t\t\"Today, product teams at some of the world's most innovative companies rely on Figma. Not just because it's powerful, but because it helps people work better together. It's clearer communication, faster execution, and fewer handoff headaches. We didn't just change how design happens—we closed the gap between idea and reality.

Teams passed files back and forth, feedback got lost in threads, and by the time engineering had what they needed, the design had already changed. It was slow, inefficient, and frustrating for everyone involved.\",\n38: \t\t\"So we built something different. A browser-based platform where anyone—designer, developer, product manager—could work in the same place, at the same time. No downloads, no silos, no chaos. Just real-time collaboration that feels like magic. You could design, prototype, share, present, even engineer handoff—all in one live file that never goes out of date.\",\n39: \t\t\"Today, product teams at some of the world's most innovative companies rely on Figma. Not just because it's powerful, but because it helps people work better together. It's clearer communication, faster execution, and fewer handoff headaches. We didn't just change how design happens—we closed the gap between idea and reality.
