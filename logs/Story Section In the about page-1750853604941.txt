{"text":"Perfect! I've successfully updated the story section for Figma's about page. The new story is told in 3 compelling paragraphs that:\n\n1. **First paragraph**: Sets up the problem - the frustrating reality of design and development working in silos, with inefficient handoffs and communication breakdowns.\n\n2. **Second paragraph**: Introduces Figma's breakthrough solution - a browser-based, real-time collaborative platform that eliminates the traditional barriers between teams.\n\n3. **Third paragraph**: Shows the impact and vision - how Figma has transformed how industry-leading companies work together and their continued mission to bridge the gap between idea and reality.\n\nThe story is written in a conversational, human tone that avoids technical jargon while clearly communicating Figma's value proposition and mission. It speaks directly to the pain points that designers, developers, and product managers experience, making it highly relatable and compelling for the target audience.","files":[],"reasoningDetails":[],"toolCalls":[],"toolResults":[],"finishReason":"stop","usage":{"promptTokens":87014,"completionTokens":1131,"totalTokens":88145},"warnings":[],"request":{},"response":{"id":"gen-1750853599-Uyrih3DBQXgP7NT78ySp","timestamp":"2025-06-25T12:13:24.941Z","modelId":"anthropic/claude-sonnet-4","headers":{"access-control-allow-origin":"*","cf-aig-cache-status":"MISS","cf-aig-event-id":"80fad67b-819b-4668-ba0b-ec11b8bcbc06","cf-aig-log-id":"01JYKG3FZG289YH3DH495KXTBV","cf-aig-step":"0","cf-ray":"955460d2fd619fc9-AMS","connection":"keep-alive","content-type":"application/json","date":"Wed, 25 Jun 2025 12:13:21 GMT","server":"cloudflare","set-cookie":"__cf_bm=Q2UtzJIobm6aADfzkpxIawI2gXcublbTNilp81OohbU-1750853601-1.0.1.1-_zHDKEvJV181xUnqvUB0XPPNn92XOooQi7hpMI8QaqzKJ7RAn1Fa3VktqnTSZATw0r_rMpR.IyfltHLz_jITsdZQLV_PQ68yZbq5wkGjMEc; path=/; expires=Wed, 25-Jun-25 12:43:21 GMT; domain=.gateway.ai.cloudflare.com; HttpOnly; Secure","transfer-encoding":"chunked","vary":"Accept-Encoding","x-clerk-auth-message":"Invalid JWT form.

Build better. Together.\n\nFigma has always been about making design more collaborative, but it started with a simple question: why do design and development often feel like different worlds? Teams passed files back and forth, feedback got lost in threads, and by the time engineering had what they needed, the design had already changed. It was slow, inefficient, and frustrating for everyone involved.\n\nSo we built something different. A browser-based platform where anyone—designer, developer, product manager—could work in the same place, at the same time. No downloads, no silos, no chaos. Just real-time collaboration that feels like magic. You could design, prototype, share, present, even engineer handoff—all in one live file that never goes out of date.\n\nToday, product teams at some of the world’s most innovative companies rely on Figma. Not just because it's powerful, but because it helps people work better together. It’s clearer communication, faster execution, and fewer handoff headaches. We didn’t just change how design happens—we closed the gap between idea and reality. And we’re just getting started."}],"finishReason":"tool-calls","usage":{"promptTokens":17966,"completionTokens":191,"totalTokens":18157},"warnings":[],"request":{},"response":{"id":"gen-1750853565-Xoem9hW4MxTO5jwVCdZo","timestamp":"2025-06-25T12:12:53.920Z","modelId":"anthropic/claude-sonnet-4","headers":{"access-control-allow-origin":"*","cf-aig-cache-status":"MISS","cf-aig-event-id":"b254ea56-c1e3-4b13-a494-4db88f836795","cf-aig-log-id":"01JYKG2ER9CXQE1W2ZQ00B41BD","cf-aig-step":"0","cf-ray":"95545ffe5f939fc9-AMS","connection":"keep-alive","content-type":"application/json","date":"Wed, 25 Jun 2025 12:12:49 GMT","server":"cloudflare","set-cookie":"__cf_bm=ZwPnaBKAW0dTHQRYiNrGaJcyWkMn2XiGGsVeWjqfbCA-1750853569-1.0.1.1-wMJi325JrZNLnQGZLjATvnk6RBcTtM8qDFR3zvx8wWHofqVKJIVDPaXOB1hIdwlFULtZ1kmJi5UAF8C24fSwk0LQoZYW3DMSdudpRbcnLQ8; path=/; expires=Wed, 25-Jun-25 12:42:49 GMT; domain=.gateway.ai.cloudflare.com; HttpOnly; Secure","transfer-encoding":"chunked","vary":"Accept-Encoding","x-clerk-auth-message":"Invalid JWT form.

It was slow, inefficient, and frustrating for everyone involved.\n\nSo we built something different. A browser-based platform where anyone—designer, developer, product manager—could work in the same place, at the same time. No downloads, no silos, no chaos. Just real-time collaboration that feels like magic. You could design, prototype, share, present, even engineer handoff—all in one live file that never goes out of date.\n\nToday, product teams at some of the world’s most innovative companies rely on Figma.
