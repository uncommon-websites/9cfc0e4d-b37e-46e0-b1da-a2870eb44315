I've successfully updated the Features section with 6 features that highlight Figma's key USPs and main features:\n\n## What I've accomplished:\n\n1. **Real-time collaboration** - Emphasizing Figma's core strength of live, simultaneous editing\n2. **Design-to-development bridge** - Highlighting Dev Mode and seamless handoff capabilities\n3. **AI-powered assistance** - Showcasing AI features for layout generation and efficiency\n4. **Cloud-based accessibility** - Stressing browser-based access from any device\n5. **Scalable design systems** - Focusing on consistency and reusable components\n6. **Interactive prototyping** - Demonstrating comprehensive prototype capabilities\n\nThe features are written in sentence case with concise descriptions that clearly articulate each feature's value. I've also removed the `generating` prop as requested, so the component will now display the new content instead of showing a loading state.\n\nThe copy emphasizes collaboration, efficiency, and Figma's unique position as a unified platform that serves both designers and developers—perfectly aligned with their target audience of cross-functional product teams.","files":[],"reasoningDetails":[],"toolCalls":[],"toolResults":[],"finishReason":"stop","usage":{"promptTokens":98603,"completionTokens":1328,"totalTokens":99931},"warnings":[],"request":{},"response":{"id":"gen-1750853305-0RnszrOWcHyG1kCxqUgu","timestamp":"2025-06-25T12:08:33.288Z","modelId":"anthropic/claude-sonnet-4","headers":{"access-control-allow-origin":"*","cf-aig-cache-status":"MISS","cf-aig-event-id":"ee9922af-7957-429e-9b38-17eb80bc4f7a","cf-aig-log-id":"01JYKFTGP1B13NF1QYC67X1BYA","cf-aig-step":"0","cf-ray":"955459a44f712956-AMS","connection":"keep-alive","content-type":"application/json","date":"Wed, 25 Jun 2025 12:08:28 GMT","server":"cloudflare","set-cookie":"__cf_bm=.ynfMfWubVpUSLYv2gqc8bzxtyT3x7BU3.HzZcJhmzY-1750853308-1.0.1.1-WLN9E2LnrMz3sM89U9Se0wegF4PcxVwLPpJ2ksWpDoZZlcgnxQEeNLaGuI2whZK01qccVmEs3jbA5o_DSu.SCmx0HYW8ESDR6JeoiQ7zzik; path=/; expires=Wed, 25-Jun-25 12:38:28 GMT; domain=.gateway.ai.cloudflare.com; HttpOnly; Secure","transfer-encoding":"chunked","vary":"Accept-Encoding","x-clerk-auth-message":"Invalid JWT form.
