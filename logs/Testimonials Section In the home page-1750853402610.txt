{"text":"Perfect! I've successfully updated the testimonials section with three new testimonials that focus on:\n\n1. **Time Savings** - Keiran Holt (male): Shows how Figma reduced sprint cycles from 3 weeks to 10 days and increased velocity by 40% through better collaboration.\n\n2. **Risk Mitigation** - Laila Etienne (female): Demonstrates how Figma eliminated late-stage design revisions that were costing $50K per quarter and prevented costly rebuilds.\n\n3. **Money Savings** - Brenna Walsh (female): Highlights how Figma replaced six tools, saving $180K annually in licenses, increased productivity by 35%, and reduced onboarding time from 2 weeks to 3 days.\n\nEach testimonial:\n- Uses unique, professional names (avoiding common names like John, Maria, etc.)\n- Has gender-appropriate images that match the names\n- Shows specific, measurable benefits (time percentages, dollar amounts, concrete timeframes)\n- Comes from realistic job titles and companies\n- Focuses on different aspects of value (time, risk, money)\n\nI've also removed the \"generating\" prop from the UseCases component as requested. The testimonials now tell a compelling story about the tangible business benefits teams can expect from using Figma.","files":[],"reasoningDetails":[],"toolCalls":[],"toolResults":[],"finishReason":"stop","usage":{"promptTokens":137595,"completionTokens":2017,"totalTokens":139612},"warnings":[],"request":{},"response":{"id":"gen-1750853393-VHCtG7KT6sVXwwgGqKCm","timestamp":"2025-06-25T12:10:02.610Z","modelId":"anthropic/claude-sonnet-4","headers":{"access-control-allow-origin":"*","cf-aig-cache-status":"MISS","cf-aig-event-id":"d15ead9e-831a-457e-8baa-56e8baba83fb","cf-aig-log-id":"01JYKFX6KX06KBHJ2HQH3602HQ","cf-aig-step":"0","cf-ray":"95545bca39e79707-AMS","connection":"keep-alive","content-type":"application/json","date":"Wed, 25 Jun 2025 12:09:57 GMT","server":"cloudflare","set-cookie":"__cf_bm=m15b3mXwXpuJYunV4Z.GwEugLePNnK.i6su24Epl9Y4-1750853397-1.0.1.1-Ob2ItI5ng9I27CNaujWl9oknPmlvgcuxIfFqTa8.MMflzkku.yxNmld0z0NXMhrWIp.Um3v4vhNSQ4G3ieSz_pIbK3wTLe_P4dLnJddAq5U; path=/; expires=Wed, 25-Jun-25 12:39:57 GMT; domain=.gateway.ai.cloudflare.com; HttpOnly; Secure","transfer-encoding":"chunked","vary":"Accept-Encoding","x-clerk-auth-message":"Invalid JWT form.
