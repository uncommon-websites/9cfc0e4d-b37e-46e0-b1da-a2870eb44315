If `centered` is `false` (or not provided), the content will be aligned to the left, with the image on the right (xl:grid-cols-[1fr_auto]).\n\n**Example of using `Hero.svelte` with the `centered` prop:**\n\n```svelte\n<Hero\n    title=\"Welcome\"\n    subtitle=\"This is a centered hero section\"\n    imageSrc=\"/path/to/image.jpg\"\n    callsToAction={[\n        { href: \"/get-started\", label: \"Get Started\" }\n    ]}\n    centered={true}\n/>\n```\n\nIn this example, the title, subtitle, and button will be centered.

I need to find the regular_left hero style and understand how to use the centered prop."},"result":"Okay, I will help you with your questions about the hero components.\n\n**Available Hero Components and Props:**\n\nThe `hero-sections` folder contains the following hero components:\n\n*   **Hero.svelte**:\n    *   `centered`: (boolean, optional) -  If true, centers the content.\n    *   `title`: (string) - Main headline.\n    *   `subtitle`: (string) - Supporting text.\n    *   `imageSrc`: (string, optional) - Hero image URL.\n    *   `callsToAction`: (array, optional) - An array of objects, each with `href` (string) and `label` (string) properties, representing the call-to-action buttons.\n*   **CenteredTextOnlyHero.svelte**:\n    *   `title`: (string) - Main headline.\n    *   `subtitle`: (string) - Supporting text.\n    *   `imageSrc`: (string) - Image source.\n    *   `callsToAction`: (array, optional) - An array of objects, each with `href` (string) and `label` (string) properties, representing the call-to-action buttons.\n*   **CustomerCardHero.svelte**:\n    *   `centered`: (boolean, optional) - If true, centers the content.\n    *   `title`: (string) - Main headline.\n    *   `subtitle`: (string) - Supporting text.\n    *   `customers`: (array) - An array of customer objects, each with `name`, `position`, and `imageSrc` properties.\n    *   `callsToAction`: (array, optional) - An array of objects, each with `href` (string) and `label` (string) properties, representing the call-to-action buttons.\n*   **SecondaryHero.svelte**:\n    *   `title`: (string) - Main headline.\n    *   `subtitle`: (string) - Supporting text.\n    *   `imageSrc`: (string) - Image source.\n*   **StyledHero.svelte**:\n    *   `title`: (string) - Main headline.\n    *   `subtitle`: (string) - Supporting text.\n    *   `imageSrc`: (string) - Hero image URL.\n    *   `callsToAction`: (array, optional) - An array of objects, each with `href` (string) and `label` (string) properties, representing the call-to-action buttons.\n\n**Using the `centered` prop in `Hero.svelte`:**\n\nThe `centered` prop in the `Hero.svelte` component controls the alignment of the content. When `centered` is `true`, the content (title, subtitle, and call-to-action buttons) will be centered horizontally.  If `centered` is `false` (or not provided), the content will be aligned to the left, with the image on the right (xl:grid-cols-[1fr_auto]).\n\n**Example of using `Hero.svelte` with the `centered` prop:**\n\n```svelte\n<Hero\n    title=\"Welcome\"\n    subtitle=\"This is a centered hero section\"\n    imageSrc=\"/path/to/image.jpg\"\n    callsToAction={[\n        { href: \"/get-started\", label: \"Get Started\" }\n    ]}\n    centered={true}\n/>\n```\n\nIn this example, the title, subtitle, and button will be centered. If you omit `centered={true}`, the content will be left-aligned.\n"}],"finishReason":"tool-calls","usage":{"promptTokens":18219,"completionTokens":120,"totalTokens":18339},"warnings":[],"request":{},"response":{"id":"gen-1750853146-RvycgJrUWb1LGFDq37lt","timestamp":"2025-06-25T12:05:51.600Z","modelId":"anthropic/claude-sonnet-4","headers":{"access-control-allow-origin":"*","cf-aig-cache-status":"MISS","cf-aig-event-id":"c9732f59-ba58-4a05-a735-a071835da0ca","cf-aig-log-id":"01JYKFNP7EJAC91AHPPF7SE3T8","cf-aig-step":"0","cf-ray":"955455c7ae4c6d99-AMS","connection":"keep-alive","content-type":"application/json","date":"Wed, 25 Jun 2025 12:05:49 GMT","server":"cloudflare","set-cookie":"__cf_bm=jx.P3nbGms6uBKzED7KzqhiQuZn0yf4VnzpO_VKh_nA-1750853149-1.0.1.1-aA7n2rjopogPhzUAi6naEo759g_06fV4CAoBdeMmePBeLsm72OaqdGaoptI_wcOZI10sDNsiCF8T4rxE7uBnimV4qv.pYGIbbOO1_ByUFJI; path=/; expires=Wed, 25-Jun-25 12:35:49 GMT; domain=.gateway.ai.cloudflare.com; HttpOnly; Secure","transfer-encoding":"chunked","vary":"Accept-Encoding","x-clerk-auth-message":"Invalid JWT form.

If `centered` is `false` (or not provided), the content will be aligned to the left, with the image on the right (xl:grid-cols-[1fr_auto]).\n\n**Example of using `Hero.svelte` with the `centered` prop:**\n\n```svelte\n<Hero\n    title=\"Welcome\"\n    subtitle=\"This is a centered hero section\"\n    imageSrc=\"/path/to/image.jpg\"\n    callsToAction={[\n        { href: \"/get-started\", label: \"Get Started\" }\n    ]}\n    centered={true}\n/>\n```\n\nIn this example, the title, subtitle, and button will be centered.
